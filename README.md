# Implementation of Li's Algorithm #
This program is an implementation of the (2+*&epsilon;*)-approximation algorithm
for solving the scheduling problem 1|prec|&sum;<sub>*j*</sub> *w<sub>j</sub>* *C<sub>j</sub>*
in

*O*((*n*+*&kappa;*) &dot; polylog(*n*+*&kappa;*) &dot; log<sup>3</sup>(max<sub>*j*</sub> *p<sub>j</sub>*) &dot; 1/ *&epsilon;*<sup>2</sup>)<br>

time, where *n* is the number of jobs, *&kappa;* is the number of precedence constaints, and *p<sub>j</sub>* is the processing time of job *j*.

## Usage ##
The program is started using the command line
```
julia --project main.jl [instance path] [epsilon]
```
where `[instance path]` is a path to a JSON file representing an instance,
and `[epsilon]` is a number between 0 and 1, being the parameter *&epsilon;*.
For example, one can run
```
julia --project main.jl L_00010_7_05.json 0.5
```
to solve the instance `L_00010_7_05.json` using *&epsilon;* = 0.5.

The program writes results to standard output, as well as a file with name, e.g., `L_00010_7_05.sol.txt`, for the above mentioned instance.

## Test instances ##
The instances used for testing were generated by the program `generate.jl`,
using Julia version 1.7.3 and random seed 123456789,
provided as the first parameter to the program, i.e.,
```
julia --project utils/generate.jl 123456789 instances/
```
IP/LP formulations of the instances can exported as gzipped MPS files with a given *&epsilon;*
using the program `export.jl`,
```
julia --project utils/export.jl instances/ [epsilon] exported_instances/ [integer]
```
where `[integer]` is a boolean specifying if the variables are to be constrained to integer
values or not.
